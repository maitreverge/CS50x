Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?: With a small number of iterations, Brazil and Portugal seems to get down as the number of simulations increases

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?: After 10k simulations, the probabilities seems to get about the same.
